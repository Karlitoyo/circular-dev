## Digital Product Passport Solidity


### Smart Contracts:

- contracts/Digital_Product_Passport.sol has the main definitions of the digital product passport
- contracts/CCIP_Cross_Chain_Contract.sol Tentative of creating a multi-chain not so several chains can interact with the passport.


### Testing

Used Hardat to testing,  to run you can do: 
```npx hardhat test```

You can also run ```npx hardhat node``` so it wil start the local testnet. Then connect to this chain with Remix.


@@@ TODOs:

- [  ] CCIP interoperability Smart COntract
- [  ] Define and adjust the location for the manuals, and passport contents
- [  ] Deploy to testnet
- [  ] Deploy to mainnet?
